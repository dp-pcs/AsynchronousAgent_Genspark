### **Study Session Interface**
- **🧠 Interactive Review**: Question → Think → Reveal Answer
- **⭐ Quality Rating**: 0-5 scale with descriptions:
  - **0**: Total blackout - complete failure to recall
  - **1**: Incorrect - but remembered upon seeing answer
  - **2**: Difficult - correct response with serious difficulty
  - **3**: Hesitant - correct response with some hesitation
  - **4**: Good - correct response with minor hesitation
  - **5**: Perfect - perfect response with no hesitation
- **📊 Session Progress**: Real-time statistics and completion tracking
- **🎯 SM-2 Updates**: Automatic interval adjustments based on performance

## 🔬 **SM-2 Algorithm in Action**

### **Example Card Progression**
```
Initial Card:
- Ease Factor: 2.5
- Interval: 1 day
- Repetition: 0

After Quality 4 Review:
- Ease Factor: 2.5 (maintained)
- Interval: 1 day
- Repetition: 1

After Second Quality 4 Review:
- Ease Factor: 2.5
- Interval: 6 days
- Repetition: 2

After Third Quality 4 Review:
- Ease Factor: 2.5
- Interval: 15 days (6 × 2.5)
- Repetition: 3
```

### **Quality Impact Examples**
- **Quality 5 (Perfect)**: Increases ease factor → longer intervals
- **Quality 3 (Hesitant)**: Slightly decreases ease factor
- **Quality 1 (Failed)**: Resets to 1-day interval, reduces ease factor

## 📊 **Live Data Examples**

### **Sample Flashcards in System**
1. **Geography**: "What is the capital of France?" → "Paris"
2. **Mathematics**: "What is 2 + 2?" → "4"  
3. **Literature**: "Who wrote Romeo and Juliet?" → "William Shakespeare"

### **Current SRS State**
All cards are currently set to:
- **Ease Factor**: 2.5 (default)
- **Interval**: 1 day (new cards)
- **Total Reviews**: 0 (ready for first study session)
- **Next Review**: Immediate (all due now)
